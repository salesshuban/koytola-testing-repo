1,Estonian college drop-out became Europe’s youngest founder of Billion-dollar company Bolt,Markus Villig,"“As an entrepreneur, you sometimes get thousands of ideas that seem great and you want to do them all, but ultimately you can only do a few things really well”, says Markus Villig. (Founder of ‘Bolt’ then ‘Taxify’). A teenager who dropped out of college in Estonia became Europe’s youngest founder of a billion-dollar company. This European ride-hailing app “Bolt” is active in 30 countries with more than 30 million users and is donning a unicorn status. This success didn’t come overnight but was a result of passion and a focussed approach to achieve it. “Markus Villig started this in 2013 with just €5000 loan from his family which they had kept for his studies. The beginnings are never all hunky-dory and he faced many road bumps on the way. He started developing the prototype of the app which didn’t work well in the beginning and was all over the place as drivers couldn’t really register themselves or accept the bookings. He went to the roads to hire the drivers and tell them about this app. His customer-centric approach, discipline, and business model led to its success. He focussed on transport needs at a local level and created his niche market by charging only 15% commission per ride from drivers while all other platforms in the market charged 25%. He has so far raised approximately €300 million from investors and his valuation is €1.9 billion. It is giving a very tough competition to ride-sharing platform giant Uber in Europe and various other countries. The company has rigorously taken expansion and has entered into electric scooters, food delivering business too. He aims to make this Pan European Mobility as-a-service (MaaS) where any form of transport can be booked and paid via the account on the application. He is not leaving any stone unturned to make a mark in the market and be ahead in the race. Such stories play a crucial role in motivating young entrepreneurs to think and dream big and make them real.",static/users/xT8WC5PYblpj/success1.png,Estonia,Bolt,estonian-college-drop-out-became-europes-youngest-founder-of-billion-dollar-company-bolt,"['story', 'sucess', 'entrepreneur', 'Estonia', 'Europe']",True,False,19/06/2021,19/06/2021

3,"From local market to becoming number one internationally, Bulldog Skincare for Men making organic growth",Simon Duffy,"Two friends, Simon Duffy and Rhodri Ferrier started and launched Bulldog Skincare for Men in a room in west London with their idea to make a product specifically for the skin of men. They launched the brand in 2007 and did not think of putting exporting in their business plan since it’s a little scary for small businesses, considering the extra rules, regulations, and costs involved in trading overseas. After establishing themselves in their domestic market, they could start exporting in diverse markets including South Korea, Sweden, and Australia. They believed that their uniqueness of product, its quality, and superior performance have helped them to easily make their brand name in all the markets. They were being awarded the number 1 men’s facial skincare brand in South Korea in 2014, and in Sweden in 2016 and still hold the position. Within 11 years of its launch, they have been able to expand themselves in 27 countries around the world and hope to continue the same in the future. Business acumen and unique ideas to serve customers always help both in the domestic and international market.",static/users/xT8WC5PYblpj/bulldog.jpg,London,Bulldog Skincare for Men,from-local-market-to-becoming-number-one-internationally-bulldog-skincare-for-men-making-organic-growth,"['Skincare', 'Men', 'Success', 'Story']",True,False,19/06/2021,19/06/2021
4,Cocorose London: from being rejected by 100 factories to being present in 30 countries,Janan Leo,"It’s not really new to hear about the incidents where women have been forced to wear high heels in the corporate world. Janan Leo, who was 26 in 2007, saw this genuine issue faced by the women and also realized the gap in the market where something new or innovative can be brought about to address it while still not compromising on style. She brought an original and revolutionary concept of foldable shoes which could be carried by the women in purse and change to them when heel starts to hurt. The journey as usual was not an easy one, as she was being rejected by 100 factories before turning successful and launching it under the brand name Cocorose London. Janan has no clue about exporting at that time and rather found it daunting at first because of the various rules, costing, and uncertainty about understanding foreign markets. But ultimately it did turn out very successful and just in 10 years, her sales are 20 times more, with 70% of revenue from exports. Cocorose London is a luxury shoe brand for modern and stylish women and its products are being stocked in high-end boutiques; now present in 30 countries and generating revenue of over £1m. It’s about pushing the boundaries and never to giving up on your idea and product.",static/users/xT8WC5PYblpj/janan.jpg,London,Cocorose London,cocorose-london-from-being-rejected-by-100-factories-to-being-present-in-30-countries,"['Shoes', 'High Heels', 'Success', 'Story']",True,False,19/06/2021,19/06/2021

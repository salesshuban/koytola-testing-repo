suggests that big companies could shift a quarter of their global sourcing to new countries in the next
five years. Climatic risks, cyber-attacks, and the ongoing pandemic are all the factors acting as a
catalyst in bringing the companies to follow the trend.
In such an environment, there are few countries that are trying hard to exploit the opportunity and
project themselves as the manufacturing hub. One such emerging country is Turkey, which shows a
promising future<br></div><div><br></div><div>Is Turkey a new manufacturing destination?
Major consumer markets have mostly preferred Asia based supply system due to cheaper costs, but
global supply chain disruptions due to the COVID situation and various other factors are making them
turn towards new and closer manufacturers.
Turkey has a geographically strategic location right between Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Africa
and has always been regarded as important for global trade. Its value has further been accelerated
by the customs union with EU and an array of FTA’s with almost 30 countries, giving it access to
millions of customers.<br></div><div><br></div><div>One of the positive points to add about Turkey is its established domestic logistics network enabling
it to ship the goods faster. Its position coupled with the skilled and cost-effective workforce is
considered to be the winning formula for the success of Turkey. Though the labor cost is
comparatively higher than its far east competitors but it is still lower than others due to exchange
rates and local cost.
Manufacturing industries in Turkey are very diverse but the manufacture of textiles is its largest
industry which is very competitive in the international market and earns foreign exchange the most.
There has been a continuous change in the global clothing industry and the demand has also been
from the regions in the Far East and the Southern Hemisphere. Also, with the rise in demand in the
domestic markets in Asian countries, the export balance is changing thereby pulling the production
costs comparatively up. Turkey’s automation in production, geographical proximity, and economical
cost of production provide significant savings and an edge over its competitors. Turkey has well positioned itself to boost its manufacturing capabilities and capitalize on this opportunity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Turkish industry and technology minister also noted in March 2021 that the manufacturing industry
was the biggest contributor to Turkey's GDP performance last year amid the pandemic, suggesting it
will only expand further at a faster rate. They have been gearing up for the Fourth Industrial
Revolution and focusing on innovative research and the country’s digital transformation. Over the
years, the ranking of Turkey by World Bank in terms of ease of doing business has only gotten better
to 33 in 2019. All these conscious efforts and steps taken by the country show the fluidity and
eagerness to grow further as a manufacturing nation.
Turkey faces various roadblocks and challenges in its path to become the go-to for global production.
Few reasons which pull it on the back seat include higher political risks, currency fluctuations, and
language and cultural differences. Turkey needs to address these issues to further increase the
momentum it has gained so far.
Turkey has positioned itself well in the global value chain by offering its flexible production capabilities,
lower labor costs, and exploiting its logistical advantage. It has been focusing on upgrading its
maritime and logistic infrastructure and the government is very hopeful about the country’s growth
due to its production infrastructure even in the pandemic era.
This pandemic has made it clear that over-reliance on one country could be detrimental for the world
economy and global supply chain while emphasizing the need for diversification. The manufacturing
output of China saw an unprecedented decline due to the COVID situation and this shock has made
businesses lookout for alternatives. Turkey is innovation-driven and possesses the capability to
prosper in manufacturing. It levels out its comparative higher production costs by shorter timelines
and quick adaptability to changing markets.
With the greater focus on automation and technological advances, Turkey can emerge out as a smart
manufacturer in the globally competitive marketplace and be the one-stop destination.<br></div>","['Turkey', 'Global', 'Manufacturing', 'Hub']",True,True,03/08/2021,03/08/2021

This recovery is uneven and largely reflects sharp rebounds in some major economies. In many emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), obstacles to vaccination continue to weigh on activity. By 2022, last year’s per capita income losses will not be fully unwound in about two-thirds of EMDEs. The global outlook remains subject to significant downside risks, including the possibility of additional COVID-19 waves and financial stress amid high EMDE debt levels. Policy makers will need to balance the need to support the recovery while safeguarding price stability and fiscal sustainability and to continue efforts toward promoting growth-enhancing reforms.</span><br>","['Global', 'prospects', 'turkey']",True,True,03/08/2021,03/08/2021

But in the case of international trade, chaos and confusion come into the picture due to different countries following different trade rules. There are language barriers and the connotations of the terms might vary too; hence incoterms.</div><div>What are Incoterms?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Incoterms are international commercial terms published by ICC.

In simplest terms, it is an agreement between the parties, which decides who will be responsible if anything goes wrong in the whole process.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Incoterms influence almost all aspects of the business but they are just part of the whole export contract and do not deal with the method of payment or breach of contract.</div><div>Incoterms are updated periodically and are used as abbreviations, each signifying the roles and responsibilities in a precise manner. You can see the complete list of Incoterms 2020 here.</div><div>But before we delve into its importance, let’s understand Incoterm with an example.</div><div>There is a seller Company A which deals with industrial machinery and is located in Frankfurt (Germany).

The change this pandemic is <b>bringing in the world</b> is far from what anyone could have ever anticipated. It has created havoc in the lives of people worldwide and has left us to grapple with the challenges. The aura of despondency created by this crisis is impacting every aspect of life; be it physical, social, psychological, or financial. Economic Impact across the world The economic meltdown has been a by-product of this pandemic and no wonder WTO (World Trade Organization) estimates global trade fell 9.2% in 2020. The interconnection and inter-dependencies of world trade make this virus economically contagious too. There are restrictions and lockdowns put by the governments to curb the further spread of the virus and thereby affecting the consumers getting to stores or travel, eventually depleting the demand from the market. But in such scenarios, the psychological aspect also comes into play where consumers are scared and investors wait-and-see and tend to delay their purchases or investments. Major shocks across the world resulting in the derailment of international trade: 1. Supply-side shock: Factory closures, drop in employment, global supply chain disruptions, retrenchment in service sector industries 2. Demand-side shock: Decline in transportation, tourism, restaurants, recreational activities, education services, etc. This pandemic has posed daunting challenges to the survival of domestic or international trade. It has led to a dramatic decline in FDI flows, reduction in global production and employment and overall contraction of economies. While no country is spared from its negative impact, Turkey has still performed well in such circumstances. Let’s take a look in detail: Impact of the pandemic on Turkey Turkey, like any other country, has been affected by COVID 19 through regular channels of supply and demand shocks. There was a significant percentage of growth rate decline in the first and second quarter of 2020, but the combination of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies yielded 6.7% of growth in the third quarter of 2020. On the other hand, cheap lending expedited a record drop in LIRA, brought down the country’s foreign currency reserves, and pushed inflation to 15%. One more important aspect to consider here is the increased trade deficit in turkey during pandemic hit 2020. It already stood at around $30 billion in 2019, which further widened in 2020 due to increased imports and fall in the exports. Despite all this, Turkey is amongst one of those few countries globally that could avoid the contraction in the economy due to the Coronavirus pandemic and its growth rate was 1.8% as a whole in 2020. Turkey’s supply chain is not dependent on China and the Turkish Exporters' Assembly revealed that Turkish products were exported to some 206 countries in November 2020 suggesting</div><div>recovery continuing successfully. As per the Reuters polls of economists, turkey is expected to grow its GDP by more than 5% mostly supported by 16-20% growth in exports after the 2020 crisis. Positive Trends and growth prospects of Turkey in 2021</div><div><br></div><div><div>Downturns and crisis somehow offer a prospect of outplaying the opponents or competitors. In fierce competition with China, Turkey could maintain annual medical exports of $5 billion in 2020 fueled by the mistrust among countries for China. Turkey has been pretty proactive in exploiting the opportunity in such a dire situation. Turkey’s economy is expected to grow at 4.8% in 2021, bouncing back from the collapse brought by the pandemic, as per a Reuters poll. Turkish Exporters Assembly Chairman Ismail Gülle emphasized that pandemic has changed the shape of trade transactions and they need to invest and focus more on research and development. COVID crisis has created a temporary reduction in production capacities worldwide; with the local production costs being low in Turkey and broad manufacturing sector, it can be identified as the new production or logistics facility by the world. The weak Turkish LIRA also makes the exports comparatively cheaper. Turkey still has high untapped potential in international trade and that can be significantly brought out by further digital transformation. This pandemic has strengthened the need for companies to be more creative with their business models while integrating themselves with digitalization. The government has particularly stressed upon the fact that they would be focusing on and supporting digital marketing activities to boost e-exports. In a recent Turkish-Sweden Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) meeting held online, both countries discussed long-term trade relations and ways to boost their bilateral trade volumes $5 billion</div><div>in a balanced way. The finance minister also mentioned that the production and overall trade has come to a better position even in comparison to the pre-pandemic times. The Turkish finance minister stated that half of the economic growth of Turkey in 2021 will come from foreign trade. He also told in February 2021, that there has been trade deficit shrinkage in the new year with a rise in exports and decline in imports, showing an overall positive sign amid pandemic. This definitely brought euphoria among traders in Turkey as news hit headlines of exports reaching new heights in April 2021 and outpacing the pre-pandemic levels. Turkey’s customs union agreement with the EU coupled with its strategic location and capable human infrastructure offers a great advantage in attracting investors globally. Also, the government’s attention and efforts to boost the exports of country shows the opportunities it offers for the small and medium-sized enterprises in Turkey to turn into a successful exporter. The recurring wave of COVID is leaving the world bewildered and keeping nations on their toes to handle the human suffering and unprecedented economic shock. A strong economy can always help in dealing with such circumstances in a better way. All these trends are suggestive of the fact that recovery in Turkey from pandemic hit 2020 is on track and strategic steps can defer or completely avoid any further damage. It also motivates the small enterprises to think big and enter into the international trade through digital medium amid Pandemic.

42,24/06/2021,,2021-08-03,,,Corporate Culture,92,why-is-right-corporate-culture-indispensable-for-survival,Why is Right Corporate Culture indispensable for survival?,static/users/xT8WC5PYblpj/Right_corporate_culture.jpg,,"<div>""You can have all the right strategy in the world; if you don't have the right culture, you're dead."" - Patrick Whitesell</div><div>This statement by Patrick Whitesell, Co-CEO at WME speaks volumes about the significance of the right culture in an organization. More than ever there has been quite a buzz around corporate culture now and how it’s challenging to recognize its state inside the company. Before we dive deep into its dynamics, let’s take a step back to first understand what exactly the corporate culture is.</div><div>What is Corporate Culture?</div><div>All companies aim to provide the best of products and services to their customers. While that should be the case; how would anyone achieve it if the employees working in that organization are not happy and thus not productive? If the family members in a house are fighting with each other and do not know on what principles they exist, what are their values, how are they going to welcome an outsider and treat him well? The internal dynamics of a company is reflected in the teams’ efficiency and their experience with the customers.</div><div>Corporate Culture is, therefore, sum-total of how the employees interact with each other at their workplace. It includes rules &amp; guidelines, frameworks, policies, norms and the values on which the company works. It can be seen embedded in the day to day activities and processes of a company such as hiring, rewards systems and promotions etc.</div><div>While defining corporate culture in words might seem simple, but in reality, it’s very complicated to ascertain what kind of culture exists and what impact it holds on organization, business, employees and customers.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Holistic Impact of Culture</div><div>As per Deloitte’s report, it has been found that Exceptional Organizations think about their business as a two-sided ledger: strategy and culture. Also, the majority of executives and employees believe that workplace culture is important for business success.</div><div>While the strategy is more of a logical approach to running the business and ensuring that the organizational resources, structure and design, portfolios and management fit together in such a way to create the maximum value; Culture, on the other hand, is more of intangible aspect which focuses on people factor and ensures that employees can thrive in the workplace.</div><div>When analyzed deeply, one can realize that employees are the main asset of any organization. One person might have the best of ideas but to implement it in reality, a team is needed. If those people are not taken care of if they are not happy if they are not well - what result do you expect? CFO has co-related the fact that companies with good cultures positively impact their share prices. This should not come to anybody as a surprise since positive environment impacts the employee’s mental, physical and emotional well-being and thereby transforms the organization into an efficient team.</div><div>Indeed, culture can’t be measured in quantifiable terms but it definitely can be seen in the long term performance of the company. Though no two companies can have the same culture and values, still there are few attributes which are found common in them:</div><div>• Brand identity</div><div>• Attract talent</div><div>• Loyal and engaged workforce</div><div>• Higher retention of talent</div><div>• Delighted and loyal customers</div><div>• Innovation</div><div>As per the Harvard Business Review, firms with rich corporate culture have more chances to outperform the ‘culturally unremarkable’ competitors. Thus, the right corporate culture is good for business in the long run. Now that we have understood about what corporate culture is and how it affects the organization; the question which arises is why and how it is crucial for even survival?</div><div>Why the right culture is crucial in current times?</div><div>• Organizations which are satisfied with the status quo and not innovating will surely fall off the cliff very soon</div><div>• Those who are still working with management by fear methodology will no longer be able to retain the talent especially the millennials</div><div>• Culture of over-work will not be able to sustain the growth in the longer run</div><div>What is common in all the above scenarios? Focus on employees and work-life balance is missing. In Business Roundtable, the top CEO’s of the companies agreed and realized that in changing times the focus on employees and customers is of paramount importance and not just the shareholders. Only when the employees are happy and find meaning in their work, they can satisfy the customers.</div><div>Setting realistic goals, maintaining diversity while ensuring inclusion and employees working together towards clearly defined mission sharing same values are few factors which would help the company achieve the right culture in the organization.</div><div>All the successful leaders have put great emphasis on the relevance of culture ever-evolving market. In the book “Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?” Lou Gerstner, former CEO and Chairman of IBM (1993-2002) wrote :&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>“I came to see in my time at IBM that culture isn’t just one aspect of the game - it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value.”</div><div>Again, Adam Bryant in his book “Quick and Nimble” has compared the successful culture with the greenhouse where people and ideas can flourish.</div><div>Right corporate culture can take an organization to a zenith in the long run; on the other hand toxic culture can let the company hit its bottom and succumb to death eventually. When asked upon few companies would sound unaware about their culture as if it’s not something to be focused upon; results have been found detrimental in such cases.</div><div>Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, shared about the dangers of not giving enough weightage to the culture in his start-up LinkExchange. He mentioned that the main reason for selling the company to Microsoft was that their culture went completely downhill and the employees were not willing to come to the office even though they worked day and night to make it work.</div><div>While the above one is an example of not prioritizing the culture; there are companies which developed toxic cultures thereby leading to their downfall.</div><div>Theranos’ case is the classic example where toxic culture inside the company led to complete shutdown and massive fraud charges against them. We all know that Leaders lead by example and to a great extent affect the way people in that organization work and perceive the things. In Theranos’ case, top leaders Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani were the main reason behind the dysfunctional culture as they would object to any employee who would not agree with them and raise a concern. Management by fear, secrecy, hype and overworking was an integral part of their company.</div><div>Similar such example is of United Airlines, where the CEO Oscar Munoz tried to defend the violent deplaning of passenger and wrote to employees in an internal letter that he stands behind them and commend that they went above and beyond to ensure their functioning was smooth. While this mail might sound motivating but it implies that top management only cares about the process and not about the people. It depicts that the status of employees in that organization is at a very low level. These companies have cultural problems deep-rooted in their top management which ultimately percolates down to their employees.</div><div>Reputation or Brand Value takes a lot of toils and hard work to be built but cultural problems can lead to their failures sooner than anybody can think as seen above and can completely tarnish the image. In nutshell, we can deduce from the discussion that for any organization to succeed or even to survive, right cultural integration is indispensable.</div></div>",[],True,True,24/06/2021,24/06/2021
